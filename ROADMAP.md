This document is meant to provide a prioritized list of tasks I wish to complete, in order to improve and, ultimately release a stable version of this project.

✅ 0.1.0 — Removed dependency upon `request` (`node-streamelements` replaced with custom drop-in.)

✅ 0.2.0 — Error System revamped. Simple, extensible, and practical.

✅ 0.3.0 — Service integrations separated from modules and standardized.

✅ 0.4.0 — Internationalization started. Integrated [Polyglot.js](https://github.com/airbnb/polyglot.js) for [i18n](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n) compliance

# 0.5.0 `tmi.js`

- expand available events
- document available resources in Wiki
- research services provided and exploit as many as are practical
- provide access to customize tmi.js through initialization options

# Other (To Be Scheduled)

Before 1.0, I'd like to see many other features and changes to this project. Usually, that means that new tasks will be added to this list; some might be abandoned; others will get put off, while others may be prioritized more highly. Like the project, itself, this document is a work in progress.

## Currency

- Add StreamLabs currency support
- Add internal, custom currency support

## Self-Documentation

Expand to more than just commands. Allow mutiple formats, eg. plain text; HTML; GitHub-flavored Markdown (currently supports only Discord-flavored Markdown)

Allow for every appropriate element to be documented automatically.
